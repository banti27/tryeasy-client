    <p>A web application is software that runs in your web browser. Businesses have to exchange information and deliver
      services remotely. They use web applications to connect with customers conveniently and securely.</p>

    <h2>Payment Gateway Integration</h2>
    <img src="/assets/PaymentGatewayDesign.png" width="600" height="300" alt="Payement Gateway Ecosystem" />
    <p>
      A payment gateway is a merchant service provided by an e-commerce application service provider that authorizes
      credit card or direct payments processing for e-businesses, online retailers, bricks and clicks, or traditional
      brick and mortar.[1] The payment gateway may be provided by a bank to its customers, but can be provided by a
      specialised financial service provider as a separate service, such as a payment service provider.

      A payment gateway facilitates a payment transaction by the transfer of information between a payment portal (such
      as
      a website, mobile phone or interactive voice response service) and the front end processor or acquiring bank.

      Payment gateways are a service that helps merchants initiate ecommerce, in-app, and point of sale payments for a
      broad variety of payment methods. The gateway is not directly involved in the money flow; typically it is a web
      server to which a merchant's website or POS system is connected. A payment gateway often connects several
      acquiring
      banks and payment methods under one system.

    <h2>CI/CD Pipeline</h2>
    <img src="/assets/CICDSetupDesign.png" width="600" height="300" alt="Payement Gateway Ecosystem" />
    <p>
      CI and CD stand for continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deployment. In very simple terms, CI
      is a modern software development practice in which incremental code changes are made frequently and reliably.
